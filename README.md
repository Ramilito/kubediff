## About The Project

### What
This cli tool written in Rust is a wrapper around kubectl diff 

### Why
Ever asked yourself, what is deployed on my cluster?
Or, are all changes applied to the cluster? What have I forgotten to deploy? Has something changed without us knowing it? Forgot to add a change in git after hotfixing it in prod? Well, look no further...well a couple of lines further, I guess...

### How

## Getting Started

### Prerequisite

* yq is needed for filtering 

### Installation

## Usage

#### Aliases are provided for easier use, when sourced three aliases will be created.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [] Remove or include dependency on yq 

## Troubleshooting
